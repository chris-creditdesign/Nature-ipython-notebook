You have just launched a live example of an IPython Notebook, an interactive computational environment that lets you combine raw code, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into one document. You can edit anything in this temporary demonstration notebook - including the text you are reading. (A real notebook could be saved and shared with colleagues). It will showcase some of the IPython notebook's capabilities for researchers. You can find more examples at this gallery of [interesting IPython Notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)."
